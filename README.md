# Movie_Recommendation
This project is a Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies based on content similarity. It uses TF-IDF vectorization to convert movie overviews into numerical form and cosine similarity to find and rank similar movies. The system is built using Python libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy, and implemented in Google Colab for easy interaction. Users can input a movie title, and the system returns a list of the most similar movies. This content-based filtering approach provides personalized suggestions and demonstrates the application of natural language processing in recommendation engines.
