# Movie_Recommendation
This project is a Music Recommendation System that suggests songs based on user input by analyzing textual metadata such as genre, artist, and lyrics. It uses TF-IDF vectorization to convert text features into numerical representations and cosine similarity to measure the closeness between songs. Built using Python libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy, the entire system is implemented in Google Colab for easy access and execution. This content-based recommendation approach allows the system to identify and recommend songs that are similar in style or content, enhancing the userâ€™s listening experience through personalized suggestions.
